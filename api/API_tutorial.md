Title: API Tutorials for Complete Beginners

# Part 1: Introduction to APIs

## Introduction

- Briefly introduce the concept of APIs and their significance in modern software development.
- Mention Python's popularity and suitability for working with APIs.
- Skill requirements: Basic Python knowledge.

## What is an API?

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface â€” an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are very important for creating interconnected software applications.

Analogy: API is like a waiter in a restaurant (API) taking orders (requests) from customers (users) and bringing back food (responses) from the kitchen (server).

## Why Python for APIs?

Simple: straightforward syntax and short learning curve are some of Python's strengths.
Powerful libraries such as `requests`.
Community support: Python is on the rise.

## Setting up environment

- Install Python
- Create a virtual env if needed.

E.g. 
```bash
python3 -m venv myprojectenv
```

- Install `requests`.

## Make your first API call

Get your hands dirty, fast! 

```python
import requests

# GET request
response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')

# Convert the response object to a dictionary
data = response.json()

print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Complete response: {data}")
```

This code sends a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API for a specific post and prints the response in JSON format.

The code returns the (fake) information:
```python
Status code: 200
Complete response: {'userId': 1, 'id': 1,
 'title': 'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit',
  'body': 'quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto'}
```

## Understanding API responses

In the code above, the status code is 200. What does it mean?

The status code indicates whether your request was successful or not, and the JSON object contains the data you requested. Common status codes include:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource doesn't exist.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required or has failed.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server side.

The results are in JSON format: `{key}: {value}`. We can call the keys from the dictionary that we want, for example:

```python
print(f"The User ID is: {data['userId']}")
```

Returns: `The User ID is: 1`.

## Practical example - Your turn

You will have to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
- Construct the request URL with the city name and API key. For example: Toronto ON.
- Make the request and parse the JSON response to extract and print specific weather information.

Compare your solution with my Python code here: [Open Weather Map](openweathermap.py).

# Part 2: Deep Dive into HTTP Methods and Handling API Responses

In this post, we will break down these concepts into simple terms, including n HTTP methods, handling API responses, and practical examples using Python's `requests` library.

## Understanding HTTP methods

### GET

A GET request is to **ask for the data** from the server. Take the exercise in previous part as example, you want to know the weather data for Toronto. You ask Open Weather Map by sending GET request, then they respond with the information in JSON format. You've completed the GET request task.

### POST

A POST request sends data to the server to **create or update** a current resource. This is like filling out a form or uploading data to a website.

### PUT

A PUT request will **replace current data with new ones**. It is like replacing a used paper towel with a new one. You do not add anything new, just replace the old or current one.

### DELETE

As the name suggests, DELETE requests are about **removing something**. It **deletes** the specified resource.

## Making API Calls with different HTTP methods

Uou can make these different types of API calls using Python's `requests` library (that's the convenient beauty of Python - simple and powerful libraries). 

Here are the syntax of API calls using `requests`:

- GET: `response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')`
- POST: `response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/data', data={'key': 'value'})`
- PUT: `response = requests.put('https://api.example.com/data/1', data={'key': 'value'})`
- DELETE: `response = requests.delete('https://api.example.com/data/1')`

## Try it yourself
