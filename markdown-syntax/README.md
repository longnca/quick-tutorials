## How to create a table of contents in Markdown

Creating a table of contents in Markdown (.md) involves using a combination of Markdown syntax and anchor links. To generate a table of contents, follow these steps:

### Step 1:

- Decide where you want to place your table of contents in your Markdown document. Typically, it's placed at the beginning, but you can put it anywhere in the document.

### Step 2: 

- Create headings in your Markdown document using the `#` symbol. 
- The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level. For example:
```md
# Introduction
## Section 1
### Subsection A
## Section 2
### Subsection B
```

### Step 3:

- To generate the table of contents, use the following syntax at the desired location:
```md
Table of Contents
-----------------
1. [Introduction](#introduction)
   1. [Section 1](#section-1)
      1. [Subsection A](#subsection-a)
   2. [Section 2](#section-2)
      1. [Subsection B](#subsection-b)
```
- In this example, we are manually creating a list of links with corresponding anchor links. The anchor links are generated by converting the headings to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens.
- Repeat this for all headings and subheadings in your document.
- Now, when you render or view your Markdown document, you'll have a clickable table of contents that allows users to navigate to specific sections by clicking on the links.
