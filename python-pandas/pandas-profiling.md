# How to use Pandas Profiling library

To generate a report of the details of a Pandas DataFrame using the `pandas-profiling` library, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1:

Install the `pandas-profiling `library if you haven't already done so. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`pip install pandas-profiling`

## Step 2:

Import the pandas_profiling module:
```python
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport # A module to quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code
```

## Step 3:

Generate the report by calling the `pandas_profiling.ProfileReport()` function on your DataFrame:

```python
# assume that 'df' is your Pandas DataFrame
report = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(df, minimal=True) # Minimal=True: to create a simplified report

ProfileReport(data, minimal=True) # Minimal=True: to create a simplified report
```

This will generate a report of the details of your DataFrame and store it in the report variable.

You can then display the report by calling `.to_widgets()` method on the report object:

```python
report.to_widgets()
```

This will open the report in an interactive HTML widget in your Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to explore the details of your DataFrame.

Alternatively, you can call the `.to_file()` method on the report object to save the report to an HTML file:

```python
report.to_file("report.html")
```
     
This will save the report to an HTML file named "report.html" in your current working directory. You can then open this file in a web browser to view the report.
